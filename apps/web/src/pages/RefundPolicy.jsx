            <p>
              Given the business-to-business (B2B) nature of our bespoke technology and consulting services, much of the work involves dedicated time, specialized expertise, and immediate deployment of resources. Therefore, all sales and service agreements are generally considered final once work has commenced or software/licenses have been provisioned.
